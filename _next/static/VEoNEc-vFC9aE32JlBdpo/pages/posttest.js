Although the \u2018flying train\u2019 may be a way off becoming a reality, Chinese scientists also announced plans for an intercity train that can travel at more than 600mph \u2013 clearly designed to compete with American Canadian inventor Elon Musk\u2019s hyperloop concept, which uses air instead of wheels and could result in speeds of more than 700mph.
